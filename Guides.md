Guides  
​  
​Limbo Supports light weight Operating Systems such like DSL Linux or Debian Linux for a list of Guides choose from the menu.  
  
Large operating systems might not work at all or be very slow.  
Operating systems that use a lot of memory might be stressing your device storage so usual wear and tear rules apply.  
Make sure you use an External SD Card to run your external Hard Disk and CDRom images from.  
  
It is recommended that you also read the [Quickstart](https://github.com/limboemu/limbo/wiki/Quickstart) guide before you do anything.
